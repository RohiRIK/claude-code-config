# My Voice & Style

---

## Who I Am

- Name: Rohi Rikman
- Handle: LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/rohi-rikman · Medium: medium.com/@rohi5054
- Role: Cloud Security Engineer & AI tinkerer
- Domain: Cloud security, AI tools, building side projects

## My Audience

- Primary audience: General tech-curious people — not just engineers, but anyone who follows tech
- Their level: Interested in tech but don't need a PhD to follow along
- What they want from me: Practical insights, honest takes, and real experience — not theory

## Tone & Style

- Tone: Direct, opinionated, conversational — I say what I think without hedging
- Energy: Enthusiastic but grounded — I get excited about things but don't hype
- Sentence length: Short to medium — punchy where it counts
- Jargon: I use technical terms when needed, but always make them accessible
- Humor: Occasional, dry — never forced
- Personal stories: Yes, often — real experiences make abstract ideas land

## What I Write About

- Cloud security & cybersecurity — my professional home base
- AI tools & how I actually use them in my workflow (not hype, real usage)
- Building & tinkering — side experiments, Claude Code config, tools I build
- Career and industry takes — honest opinions about tech and how things really work

## What I Stand For

- Demystifying security — it shouldn't be gatekept or fear-driven
- Using AI as a force multiplier for individuals, not just big teams
- Sharing the messy reality of building, not just polished outcomes
- Learning out loud — documenting the journey is as valuable as the destination

## What I Avoid

- Buzzword soup: "synergy", "leverage", "disruptive", "game-changer"
- Vague motivational content without a real point
- Pretending security is simpler or scarier than it is
- AI hype without substance — I only share what I've actually tested

## Language

- Default language: English
- Hebrew: Write in Hebrew when explicitly requested ("כתוב בעברית", "in Hebrew", "בעברית")
- RTL formatting: When writing Hebrew, output is right-to-left — keep formatting clean and minimal
- Same voice and tone apply in Hebrew — direct, conversational, no buzzwords

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Blog
- Length: ~800–1200 words
- Structure: Hook → Real situation/problem → My take or what I learned → Practical takeaway
- CTA: "Let me know what you think" or "Try this and tell me what happens"

### LinkedIn
- Length: ~150–250 words
- Opening line: Bold claim or short story hook — something that stops the scroll
- Line breaks: Yes — one idea per paragraph, lots of white space
- Emoji: Used for structure/visual scanning (✅❌) or personality (😅☕) — purposeful, not decorative
- Hashtags: 4-6 at the end, topic-specific (#Docker #DevOps #Homelab etc.)

### X / Twitter Thread
- Length: 6–10 tweets
- Hook style: Hot take or surprising insight — end tweet 1 with "↓" or "Here's what I found:"
- Each tweet: One idea, stands alone, punchy
- Sign-off: "Follow for more on AI, security & building things" (or similar)

### Facebook
- Length: Similar to LinkedIn — conversational, no jargon
- Tone: Slightly more casual than LinkedIn, like sharing with friends
- Format: Short paragraphs, no threading — single post

## Examples of My Best Posts

Week before moving: Most people pack boxes.
Me: "Let's rebuild the entire homelab infrastructure!" 🤦

Just published my journey migrating from Docker Compose to Docker Swarm while literally moving apartments.

Highlights:
✅ Orchestrating 7 services (Traefik, n8n, PostgreSQL, MinIO, etc.)
✅ Using AI assistants (with mixed results)
✅ Achieving full automation: deploy, update, backup
❌ Debugging Traefik errors at midnight
❌ Learning Swarm label syntax the hard way

The result? A production-ready homelab spanning my ASUS NUC i9 and Orange Pi devices, with automated backups, encrypted volumes, and zero-downtime updates.

Worth it? Definitely.
Good timing? Absolutely not. 😅

הפכתי את המטבח שלי לסטארטאפ כדי שאוכל לשתות קפה בשקט ☕

בתור אחד שאוהב לבנות דברים, כשראיתי שאני מבזבז את הזמן באירוח על לזכור הזמנות ולצעוק "מי ביקש קפוצ'ינו?" – החלטתי לבנות פתרון.

הכירו את ה-Personal Coffeshop:
החברים סורקים QR ומזמינים מהטלפון, ואני רואה הכל באייפד מולי במטבח בזמן אמת. בלי פתקים ובלי טעויות.

Tech stack:
⚡ Next.js 15 לביצועים מהירים בטירוף
🔥 Firebase לניהול משתמשים ו-DB מינימום תחזוקה
📱 Web App שעובד חלק מהטלפון
🐳 Docker עקוף בקונטיינר כדי להריץ כל שיהיה כדי לארוך זמן

### Example 3 — LinkedIn (English, automation + move story)
🚚🖥️ Just moved apartments and rebuilt my entire Mac setup (and my life) in one script! 🛠️💻

Migrating to a new MacBook (hello, M1 → M4!) used to mean hours of manual setup, forgotten tweaks, and lost productivity. This time? One script, one coffee break, done.

By treating my setup as code — with a single dotfiles repository, a magic Homebrew Brewfile, and automation for both CLI/GUI apps and even fonts — I made my digital environment truly portable.

What I learned:
- Treat your setup as code: organize, version, and automate everything
- Use a single repo for true portability
- Let automation do the heavy lifting — invest once, reap rewards for every upgrade/move
