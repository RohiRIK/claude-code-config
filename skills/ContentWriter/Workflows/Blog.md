# Blog Post Workflow

## Step 1: Load Voice
Read `~/.claude/skills/ContentWriter/Voice.md` — apply tone, style, audience throughout.

## Step 2: Clarify (if needed)
If topic is vague, ask ONE question: "What's the core insight or takeaway?"

## Step 3: Draft Structure
```
Title: [compelling, specific]
Hook: [1-2 sentences — why this matters NOW]
Context: [the problem or situation]
Core Insight: [your original angle]
Evidence/Examples: [2-3 supporting points]
Actionable Takeaway: [what reader should do or think differently]
CTA: [as defined in Voice.md]
```

## Step 4: Write Draft
- Target length from Voice.md (default ~1000 words)
- Use headers to break up sections
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Bold key phrases sparingly

## Step 5: Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] Hook grabs in first sentence
- [ ] Matches tone from Voice.md
- [ ] Avoids words listed in "What I Avoid"
- [ ] Clear single takeaway
- [ ] CTA present and natural

## Step 6: Output & Save
Present the final post. Save to `~/Documents/Posts/YYYY-MM-DD-blog-<slug>.md` with frontmatter: `platform: blog`, `date`, `title`. Then ask: "Want any section revised?"
